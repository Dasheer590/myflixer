## Setup and Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Dasheer590/myflixer.git
    cd myflixer
    ```

2. **Navigate to the server directory:**

    ```sh
    cd server
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following content:

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    CONNECTION_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@myflixer.dtfyxsy.mongodb.net/sample_mflix?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=myflixer
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```

5. **Start the server:**

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Environment Variables

The project requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server runs.
- `CONNECTION_URL`: The MongoDB connection URL.
- `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key for JWT.

## API Endpoints

The following are the main endpoints provided by the API:

### Movies

- **GET** `/movies` - Get all movies
- **GET** `/movies/:id` - Get a single movie by ID
- **POST** `/movies` - Add a new movie
- **PUT** `/movies/:id` - Update a movie by ID
- **DELETE** `/movies/:id` - Delete a movie by ID

### Users

- **POST** `/users/signup` - User registration
- **POST** `/users/login` - User login
- **GET** `/users/:id` - Get user profile
- **PUT** `/users/:id` - Update user profile
- **DELETE** `/users/:id` - Delete user profile

## Authentication

All endpoints are secured with JWT authentication. Users must log in to obtain a JWT token, which should be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for all subsequent requests.

## Testing with Postman

To test the API endpoints, you can use Postman:

1. **Install Postman**: Download and install Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

2. **Import Postman Collection**: Import the provided Postman collection (if available) to get all the pre-configured requests.

3. **Set Authorization**: For protected routes, set the Authorization header with the JWT token obtained from the login endpoint.

    ```plaintext
    Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
    ```

4. **Send Requests**: Use the Postman interface to send requests to the API endpoints and observe the responses.
